# Mouse-10X

This is the preliminary data repository for an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 immunization project. Data includes post-CellRanger VDJ sequences, as well as paired heavy and light chains, with annotated featue barcoding columns. Results include binding and neutralization assays for selected monoclonal antibodies. These data are part of an ongoing, yet unpublished project - please reach out (benjamin.murrell@ki.se) if you have an interest in using this dataset.
